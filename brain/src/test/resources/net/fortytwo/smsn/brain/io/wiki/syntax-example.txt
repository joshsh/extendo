* basic syntax
    * Semantic Synchrony uses a slight variant of wiki list syntax
    * basically, you have nested notes with attribute-value pairs, bulleted lines, and free-form text
    * attributes appears at the top of the document
    * a tree of bulleted lines appears in the middle of the document
    * free-form text comes at the end
* indentation
    * all white space before the bullet is indentation
    * it determines the degree of nesting
    * nodes can be nested to any degree
        * like this...
            * and this...
                * and this
    * a child must be indented more than its parent
      * and identically to its siblings
      * but it can be indented differently than its cousins
* white space
    * tab characters are converted to four spaces each: "    "
    * all other whitespace characters count as single spaces: " "
    * 	 leading and/or trailing whitespace is trimmed
    * blank lines don't matter
* ids
    * :0txXBm: each topic has a base-62 id, which is indicated with an infix after the bullet
    *    :cE85nD:    the id is optional, and it is treated as white space
* ordinary bullets
    * the asterisk is the default bullet, but
    - other single characters can also be bullets
    *  at least one space is required between bullet and value
    *        but more spaces are OK, too
    * these bullets mark a node as the subject or object of a statement
-- heading bullets
    * heading nodes begin with the heading bullet "--"
    * they are syntactically equivalent to bulleted nodes ("*"), but they have different semantics
    * a heading node represents a relationship
    -- :gzScm: additional comments
        * the above heading has an id (which identifies it with a topic)
* embedded properties
