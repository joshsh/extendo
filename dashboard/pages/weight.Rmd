```{r, error=FALSE}
require.entities()
```

## @weight property

```{r}
mean.weight <- mean(entities$weight)
sd.weight <- sd(entities$weight)
```

SmSn's `@weight` property ranges from 0 to 1 and is used to convey importance or emphasis; entities with higher weight are displayed more prominently in the user interface, and rank higher in search results. 
In this graph, the mean weight of entities is **`r num(mean.weight)`** (&sigma;=`r num(sd.weight)`).
The distribution of entity weights is show below.

```{r}
showFreqTable(entities$weight)
```

### Invalid weights

```{r}
invalid.weight.entities <- subset(entities,
  weight == 0 | weight > 1.0 | (weight*4)%%1 != 0)
```

Every `@weight` property should have a value of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0; any other weight is invalid, including 0.0.
This graph has **`r num(nrow(invalid.weight.entities))` invalid weight value(s)**.

```{r}
if (nrow(invalid.weight.entities) > 0) {
  showTable(entities.for.display(invalid.weight.entities))
}
```
