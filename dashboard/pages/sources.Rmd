## Data sources

```{r}

```

A SmSn knowledge graph is organized into *data sources*, which are like buckets for graph data.
Each data source contains any number of entities and relationships, and any set of data sources may be combined to form a data set, or *graph*.
The current graph contains **`r num(total.sources)` data sources** with names and entity counts as below.

```{r}
showFreqTable(entities$source)
```
