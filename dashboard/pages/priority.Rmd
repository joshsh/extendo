## @priority property

```{r}
require.entities()

entities.with.priority <- subset(entities, priority > 0)
total.with.priority <- nrow(entities.with.priority)

df <- as.data.frame(table(entities$priority))
t.priority <- data.frame(priority=df$Var1, count=sapply(df$Freq, num))
```

The `@priority` property is used to associate a priority or urgency with an entity; entities with non-zero priority are displayed with an underline in the UI, and may appear higher in search results.

There are **`r num(total.with.priority)` entities** `r perc.of.entities(total.with.priority)` in the graph with non-zero priority. The frequency of priority levels is shown below.

```{r}
showFreqTable(entities$priority)
```
